# Sesame Credit Quiz

A humorous, interactive social credit score quiz built with Python and Streamlit. Inspired by China's Social Credit System, this app asks users ten lighthearted questions about their financial habits, social behavior, community involvement, and personal style — then calculates a satirical "Social Credit Score" between 350 and 950.

Based on their score, users are awarded a tier (VIP, Gold, Silver, or Bronze) along with a set of absurd but entertaining social perks — everything from "red carpet service at coffee shops" to "honorary title as the Mogul of Mingling."

## How It Works

- Users answer 10 multiple-choice questions, each scored on a scale of 0–20 points
- A total raw score is calculated and mapped to a predicted Social Credit Score (350–950)
- The score determines a tier and a corresponding set of humorous social benefits
- Users can retake the quiz at any time
